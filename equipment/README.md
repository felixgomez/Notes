## Top 5 price/quality equipment for the future

This ranking is very opinionable and I change my mind twice a month aprox. Is about hardware only too. I love Apple machines but mostly for software-hardware user experience than hardware alone.

I use free software mostly of the time (not OS dependent) so I've been thinking about leaving behind the Apple ecosystem, but I have to meditate more about it.

### 1. Slimbook PRO2 Intel i5 13,3" (QHD+)

Price: **944€** (i5 8ºGen - 8Gb - SSD 256 **M.2** config.). Available from [Slimbook webpage](https://slimbook.es/pedidos/slimbook-pro-13/pro2-intel-i5-13-comprar).

PROS: Impressive configuration options (OS, keyboard, etc.), quality design, support, Spanish company.

CONS: Maybe the assembly time in some modes. I'd like to have some feedback about the trackpad.

### 2. Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air 13,3"

Price in Spain: **899€** (i5 8ºGen - 8Gb - SSD 256 config.) This notebook is available via [pccomponentes.com](https://www.pccomponentes.com/xiaomi-mi-air-133), even though I prefer american keyboard layout as the spanish one is [very weird](https://www.xataka.com/ordenadores/xiaomi-mi-laptop-air-13-3-tiene-teclado-espanol-su-distribucion-rarisima).

As far as I know there is no option of buying this equipment in Spain with american layout... So it has to be adquired via Chinese online market. **On special occasions, it has been priced at 670€ at Chinese stores!!!**. The lack of support (supposedly) is the biggest handicap against this notebook.

I prefer the 13,3 screen version as I think is more portable, but the 15,6" is a good candidate too and probably has less heating issues [https://www.pccomponentes.com/xiaomi-mi-air-133](https://www.pccomponentes.com/xiaomi-mi-air-133).

PROS: PRICE, metal quality construction, standard components, spare parts avaliable, scalable (memory, hard disk, etc.).

CONS: Support, reported overheating (due to MX150 dedicated graphic card), screen brightness, trackpad quality.

### 3. Apple Macbook Pro 2018 model

Price: **1999€** (i5 8ºGen - 8Gb - SSD 256 config.).
[Official page](https://www.apple.com/es/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/13-pulgadas-gris-espacial-256gb-de-cuatro-n%C3%BAcleos-a-2,3-ghz#)

Although this would be my first decision a few years ago, now I have many doubts.

PROS: Used to work with them, overall user experience, perfect trackpad, battery duration.

CONS: Price, lack of confidence with new models (probably subjective due to recent keyboard failures), lack of hardware scalability.

### 5. Dell XPS Developer (2018 edition)

Price: **1328,74€** (i5 8ºGen - 8Gb - SSD 256 **M.2** config.)
[Official page](https://www.dell.com/es-es/shop/deals/nuevo-xps-13/spd/xps-13-9370-laptop/cnx37001).

Often available at a lower price through codes and coupons.

PROS: 4K UHD, awesome battery duration, perfect keyboard, wide trackpad.

CONS: Webcam.


### 4. Lenovo Thinkpad T480s (14")

Price: **1381,60€** (i5 8ºGen - 8Gb - SSD 256 **M.2** config.). [Official page](https://www.lenovo.com/es/es/laptops/thinkpad/t-series/ThinkPad-T480s/p/20L7CTO1WWESES0).

Often available at a lower price through codes and coupons.

PROS: Proven quality, highly scalable, durability, WQHD screen.

CONS: Trackpad, black plastic exterior.
